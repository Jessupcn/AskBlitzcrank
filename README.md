## AskBlitzcrank

# Description

AskBlitzcrank is a simple League of Legends Discord bot that will pull back analyze a player's Summoner data.

# Running

You can run the bot locally by adding a file to the top level called auth.json. This file should be structured as:

{
"token": "ADD_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE",
"leagueToken": "ADD_RIOT_API_TOKEN_HERE",
}

Once deployed, the bot will look for these tokens as .env variables.
